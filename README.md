# JavaScript Homework 03 (GoIT Neoversity) – Arrays and Functions

## Project Overview  
This project is a set of JavaScript exercises from GoIT Neoversity.

The main task is to create three functions using arrays and iterations.
The main tasks of each function are:

**Task 1.** Create a Slug generator. Namely, a function that takes the title of the article, the title parameter, and returns a slug created from this line.

**Task 2.** Build a function that creates an array that contains all the elements from the first array specified in the arguments to the function, and then all the elements from the second in the order of the arguments. The main condition is the number of elements in the array, which is limited by the maxLength parameter.

**Task 3.** Create a function that takes an array of numbers and a value as parameters. The function should return a new array of only those numbers from the "numbers" array that are greater than the value.

## File Structure  
Each task is implemented in a separate file inside the project folder:  

goit-js-hw-03/ 

├── js/  
│ ├── task-1.js  
│ ├── task-2.js   
│ └── task-3.js  
├── index.html  
├── .gitignore  
├── .prettierrc  
└── README.md  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Click on GitHub Pages link in description to this project.  
3. Open the browser console (DevTools → Console) to see the results of function calls.  

## Conclusions

- Learned to use arrays as function arguments.

- Improved knowledge of using iterations.

- Practiced acquired skills in constructing functions.

- Practiced array methods.

- Improved understanding of using loops and logical operators.
